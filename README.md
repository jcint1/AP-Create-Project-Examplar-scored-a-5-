# AP-Create-Project-Examplar-scored-a-5-

This repository is intended to be used as an examplar 
for classes or individuals seeking help or direction 
on their AP Create Project, especially if using JavaScript 
as the source language. This project was made by me last year
for the AP Create and ended up scoring a 5, as it followed
all guidelines. Enjoy!
