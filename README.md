# AP-Create-Project-Examplar-scored-a-5-

This repository is intended to be used as an examplar 
for classes or individuals seeking help or direction 
on their AP Create Project, especially if using JavaScript 
as the source language. This project was made by me last year
for the AP Create and ended up scoring a 5, as it followed
all guidelines. This project is a program that takes the 
inputs (name, grade level, and current math class) to determine,
in the output, if they are ahead, on-level, or behind in math.
It's a simple design, yet it meets all criteria for the AP
Create and solves a problem, so use this as inspiration.


Enjoy!
